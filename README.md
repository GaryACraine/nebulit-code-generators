## How to use the Generators

The Generators use a json representation of an Event Model to generate Code or Documentation.
The Tool to generate the json-file is the [Miro Event Modeling Toolkit](https://miro.com/marketplace/eventmodeling/)

To learn how to use Event Modeling, you can start with the Book:
[Understanding Eventsourcing](https://leanpub.com/eventmodeling-and-eventsourcing)

To apply it in practice, you can use the companion course to the book.
[Implementing Eventsourcing](https://www.eventsourcingcourse.com)

The course includes a free Miro Toolkit License.
